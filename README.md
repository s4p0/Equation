# Equation
##Parse and calculate math expressions with constants and function.

A .NET (Mono compatible) C# implementation of [Shunting-yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm)

This solution supports:

  * use of unary operations;
  * prioritizations using parenthesis;
  * easy to create new constant support (list below);
  * easy to create new function support (list below);
  * and, all done converting it to postfix format.
  
  
Functions supported:
  * basic math operations [+-*/];
  * sqrt;
  * power;
  * and, it is easy to implement others.
  
Constants supported:
  * E;
  * PI;
  * RAD;
  * and, it is easy to implement others.
  
  
ps.: it does not implement a full parenthesis check or any syntax analyze.
